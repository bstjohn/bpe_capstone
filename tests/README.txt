  This is a testing suite that uses the Python packages Unittest, as well as
Selenium to functionally test the current Django website. A superuser must be
created to properly run the tests. Further information is included in 
'test_main.py'.

Run all tests by typing in 'python test_main.py' or an individual test by
typing in 'python test_main.py TestWebsite.<function_name>'
