This is the daemon program to be used to communicate with the BPA database
back end.  It handles sending the query to the database and then returns
the information into the Django database.  This program is intended to be
used with Python 3.3 and will require modifications to run on version 2.7
of the Python interpreter.

The daemon consists of three files:

  QueryDaemon.py    Main program that communicates with the Django program.
  QueryClient.py    Client to the BPA database program.
  DataEngine.py     Interface to the DJango database.

There are three threads of execution in the daemon to allow all three phases
of query execution to run concurrently.  The host and port numbers are at
the top of each source file.

It should be possible to modify this program to run inside the Django process
and avoid the overhead of unnecessary network communication.  This modification
would also make the code much simpler.

The daemon is started by the following command:

  python3 QueryDaemon.py

There are two addition files that are included for testing purposes:

  DaemonTest.py    Used for testing the whole daemon.
  ClientTest.py    Used for testing the BPAClient object which talks
                   to the BPA database.

These programs are started in the same way as the daemon itself is.  Both
programs take no arguments.
